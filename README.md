# **Social Platform - Front End Project**

Collaborated with my colleague Claudia Moldovan (https://github.com/Claudiamoldovan) to develop this project, aiming to replicate the core features and interface of Facebook. The key features implemented include:

* Friend request and requests lists
* Chats list featuring an intuitive chat interface with 'Seen' and 'Typing' indicators
* Posts with images
* Profile page that includes a profile picture, 'About You' section, posts list, friends list, and albums
* Feed page displaying posts from friends
* Real-time notifications that appear upon arrival and are accessible in the 'Notifications' section
* A search bar for finding friends by name
* Managed notifications using WebSocket for real-time updates
